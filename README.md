# TIMR

A simple time tracking tool for GTK, heavily inspired by [toggl](http://www.toggl.com)

Should nicely fit into elementaryOS, though it is __not__ build with any dependencies 
of elementaryOS (granite etc.), but this might change ;)

The Makefile is bullshit and must be invoked with 

	$ make -B

at the moment..
